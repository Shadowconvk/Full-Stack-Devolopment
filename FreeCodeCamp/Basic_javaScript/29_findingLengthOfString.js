//Basic JavaScript: Find the Length of a StringPassed
//You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

var length = "Alan Peter".length; // 10

//For example, if we created a variable 
var firstName = "Charles";
//we could find out how long the string "Charles" is by using the firstName.length property.

//Use the .length property to count the number of characters in the lastName variable and assign it to lastNameLength.

//You should not change the variable declarations in the // Setup section.
//lastNameLength should be equal to eight.
//You should be getting the length of lastName by using .length like this: lastName.length.
